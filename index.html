      Aye, from home's cozy nest, we'll venture west, <br>
      Through bridges and storms, we'll put our quest to the test. <br>
      At the crossroads, with maps worn and fair, <br>
      Pirate hearts ponder with a touch of dare. <br>
      I'm the opposite of right, me matey, <br>
      But not lost in the mists, nor shaded by shady. <br>
      In a direction, me spirit takes flight, <br>
      In decisions made bold, I'll steer ye right. <br>
      What am I, with me sails unfurled, <br>
      As we navigate seas, and roam the wide world?
